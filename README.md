# Counterfeit IC Detection Tutorial
The lack of traceability in the globalized electronics supply chain results in the infiltration of various counterfeit electronic parts, including recycled, remarked, overproduced, cloned, out-of-spec/defective, forged documentation, and tampered types and pose a severe threat to the security of our critical infrastructures. Among them, recycled, remarked, and cloned parts constitute most counterfeit incidents. Over the years, a class of solutions has been proposed to mitigate the widespread infiltration of these fake parts. Physical Inspection methods have gained a lot of attention due to their one-size-fits-all nature as the same methods can be applied to all types of parts (analog, digital, memory, FPGAs. etc.). Among various modalities, including optical, X-ray, thermal, electron beam microscopy, etc., optical imaging is one of the fastest and most affordable modalities.

The goal of this tutorial is to show the step-by-step process of developing a highly-accurate automated method to identify counterfeit ICs from their labeled optical images.
